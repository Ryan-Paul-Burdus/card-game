# card-game
card game (currently being created) made in my free time at home.


## How to run the game/program
- To run the program you will need to have Unity 2019.3.0a4 installed on your computer and to load up the project once this is finished.

- To run the game as a build you will need to build the game within Unity and run the .exe that is then downloaded from that. This is only because I am yet to makea build for this game at this time.
